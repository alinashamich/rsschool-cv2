Summary
-------

_My name is Alina Shamich. My preveous job experience, as you can see from my resume, is connected to the marketing sphere. 
But still, I'am here to study programming. I've recently started to study Java Script and realised, that I'm getting involved 
in programming. I feel that my future careere as an ingeneer specialist can finally make me more satisfied from my job. This 
is what I like most: a complete immersion in the search for answers  and constant upgraiding of skills. This is a very
meticulous job requiring absolute concentration on the process of a code creation, which absolutely fits me, as I am
constantly engaged in self-education, hardworking and always bring the matter to the end._
